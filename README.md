Tempus -- Robust Geotemporal Data Analysis
===============

#Background
Dynamically look at pricing patterns in markets over time. Specifically, this
software is designed to answer a few question:

* What is the price point of a product within a given market segment?
(price index generation)

* What are segments with disproportionate representation in quantity, market
value, or a separate covariate?
